# XRF Billing

XRF Billing is a very lightweight and barely functional invoice/order tracking system for XRF Core.

Note that the primary focus is now [XRF Billing for Sandstorm](https://github.com/ocdtrekkie/xrf_billing_sandstorm), and while I may port some compatible adjustments back to this version, it is deprecated at this point.
